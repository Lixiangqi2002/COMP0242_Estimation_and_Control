## Lab 2 Code Running

* For MPC, please run `mpc_controller_public.py`:

    define `consider_damping` for True or False for turning damping on or not.

* For ploting difference for Q/R (ratio between Q and R coeff), please run `plot_compare_QR.py`:
   
    define `ratio` choosing from 1000000, 10000000, 1000000000

* For ploting difference for damping coeff, please run `plot_compare_damping.py`:

    define `compare_damping_large_coeff` to plot figure of big damping coefficients or small ones.
