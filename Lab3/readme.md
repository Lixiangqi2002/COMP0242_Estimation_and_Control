## Lab 3 Code Running


* For unconstrained MPC, please run mpc_tracking.py:
    define variable for choosing reference type and control state:

`    reff = reference[0]`

`     control = control_type[0]`

* For unconstrained MPC, please run mpc_tracking_constraints.py:
    define variable for choosing reference type and control state:

`    reff = reference[0]`

`     control = control_type[0]`

* For checking constraints results, please run plot_compare_constraints.py
    define variable `cur` for different reference type
